- Energy is dissipated whenever a bit of information is destroyed. 
- Today's Digital Systems are based on irreversible logic wherein the input cannot be determined from the output. 
- As a consequence there is a loss of information. 
- This loss of information corresponds to dissipation of energy.
- Reversible Computers have a one-to-one and onto mapping between the input and output logic. 
- This means that each of the input is mapped to a unique output. 
- Therefore, the operations can be un-computed. 
- In a reversible system, overwriting operations are avoided.

In this Mini-Project I have designed and simulated a 16 - bit Logically Reversible Carry Look Ahead Adder using Intel Quartus Prime.
